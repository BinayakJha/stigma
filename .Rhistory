# stigma
Stigma instruments the Smali assembly code of commodity Android applications in order to implement dynamic information flow tracking.
Note: `stigmafy.py` runs `stigma.py` on all files that end in ".smali" in the current folder and all sub-folders (recursively).  This is largely untested on actual apps.  Currently, it is preferred to use `stigma.py` on specific files.
## SmaliClassDef
An object the represents a smali class definition.  Like Java source code, each `.smali` files contains exactly one class.
