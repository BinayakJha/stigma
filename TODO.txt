Implement a SmaliRegister class that can do things like
	register addition
	is_wide
	is_high_numbered()
	etc.

All instrumenters should be given a list of lines (maybe one line, but a list).

Change the signup method in the Instrumenter to include how many registered are needed by that instrumenter signing up

Potential bug:
The algorithm for tag propagation on a function call to an internal method is to map the first argument to the first param

	invoke-static {v1}, Ledu/fandm/enovak/MockClass;->OtherMethod(I)I
	
	we will get the tag for v1 and write that tag to MockClass_OtherMethod_p0
	This works because OtherMethod is static, so p0 is NOT this
	but what about when it is not static?  Is p0 still appropriate or
	should it be p1?

add rsub-int and rsub-int/lit8 to SmaliAssemblyInstructions

remove TYPE_CODE and TYPE_LIST stuff from SmaliAssemblyInstructions
