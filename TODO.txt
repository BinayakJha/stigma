Implement a SmaliRegister class that can do things like
	register addition
	is_wide
	is_high_numbered()
	etc.

All instrumenters should be given a list of lines (maybe one line, but a list).

Change the signup method in the Instrumenter to include how many registered are needed by that instrumenter signing up
